# Register a validator


This is a detailed step-by-step guide for setting up a JMES validator. Please be aware that while it is easy to set up a rudimentary validating node, running a production-quality validator node with a robust architecture and security features requires an extensive setup.

## Prerequisites

- You have completed [how to run a full JMES node](../run-a-full-jmes-node/README.mdx), which outlines how to install, connect, and configure a node.
- You are familiar with [JMESd](../../develop/jmesd/install-jmesd.mdx).
- You have read through [the validator FAQ](faq.mdx)
- You understand the [different keys](faq.mdx#validator-keys-and-states) of a validator in the FAQ

## 1. Get a JMES account key
   Generate a JMES account key. Replace the variable with your account key name:

   ```bash
   jmesd keys add <key-name>
   ```
   Please keep your account key information safe.

## 2. Create a new validator


<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Get coins">

For the `jmes-testnet-1`, use [the faucet](https://faucet-frontend-pr83v.ondigitalocean.app/) to send JMES to your account - you need at least 100 JMES for self-delegation.

</Admonition>


To create the validator and initialize it with a self-delegation, run the following command. `key-name` is the name of the Application Operator Key that is used to sign transactions.

```bash
jmesd tx staking create-validator \
    --amount=100000000ujmes \
    --pubkey="$(jmesd tendermint show-validator)" \
    --moniker="<your-moniker>" \
    --chain-id="<chain-id>" \
    --from="<key-name>" \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="1" \
    --fees=30000ujmes
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

When you specify commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is measured as a percentage-point change of the `commission-rate`. For example, a change from 1% to 2% is a 100% rate increase, but the `commission-max-change-rate` is measured as 1%.

## 3. Confirm your validator is active

If running the following command returns something, your validator is active:

```bash
jmesd query tendermint-validator-set | grep "$(jmesd tendermint show-address)"
```

You are looking for the `bech32` encoded `address` in the `~/.jmes/config/priv_validator.json` file.

<Admonition type="note" icon="📝">

Only the top 130 validators in voting power are included in the active validator set.

## 4. Secure your keys and have a backup plan

Protecting and having a contingency backup plan for your [keys](faq.mdx#what-type-of-key-do-i-need-to-use) will help mitigate catastrophic hardware or software failures of the node.
It is a good practice to test your backup plan on a testnet node in case of node failure.
