# Troubleshoot validator problems

Use this guide to solve the most common validator problems.

## Validator has 0 voting power

If your validator has 0 voting power, your validator has become auto-unbonded. On the mainnet, validators unbond when they do not vote on `9500` of the last `10000` blocks (`50` of the last `100` blocks on the testnet). Because blocks are proposed every ~5 seconds, a validator that is unresponsive for ~13 hours (~4 minutes on testnet) become unbonded. This problem usually happens when your JMESd process crashes.

To return the voting power back to your validator:

1. If JMESd is not running, restart it:

   ```bash
   jmesd start
   ```

2. Wait for your full node to reach the latest block, and run:

   ```bash
   jmesd tx slashing unjail <jmes> --chain-id=<chain_id> --from=<from>
   ```

   - `<jmes>` is the address of your validator account.
   - `<name>` is the name of the validator account. To find this information, run `jmesd keys list`.

If you don't wait for JMESd to sync before running `unjail`, an error message will inform you that your validator is still jailed.

1.  Check your validator again to see if your voting power is back:

   ```bash
   jmesd status
   ```

   If your voting power is less than it was previously, you may have been slashed for downtime.

## JMESd crashes because of too many open files

The default number of files Linux can open per process is `1024`. JMESd is known to open more than this amount, causing the process to crash.

1. Increase the number of open files allowed by running `ulimit -n 4096`.  

2. Restart the process with `jmesd start`.

   If you are using `systemd` or another process manager to launch JMESd, you might need to configure them. The following  sample `systemd` file fixes the problem:

   ```
   # /etc/systemd/system/jmesd.service
   [Unit]
   Description=JMES Udo Node
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=ubuntu
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu
   ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/jmesd start
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=3
   LimitNOFILE=4096

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
## JMESd crashes because of memory fragmentation

As described in [this issue](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/issues/592), huge memory allocation can cause memory fragmentation issue. Temporal solution is just using small wasm cache size like 50~100MB.

`v0.5.10+`:

```toml
contract-memory-cache-size = 100
```

`v0.5.7~v0.5.9`:

```toml
write-vm-memory-cache-size = 100
```

## The validator is not active

- The validator is jailed. To solve this problem, `unjail` the validator by running:

    `jmesd tx slashing unjail <jmes> --chain-id=<chain_id> --from=<from>`

- The validator is not in the [active validator set](../../learn/glossary.mdx#active-set). Only the top 130 validators are in this set. To fix this problem, increase your total stake to be larger than the 130th validator.
