## Hardware Requirements

The minimum requirements for running a JMES full node are:

| Network                                                                 | CPU cores     | RAM     | Disk                       | BANDWIDTH |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|----------------------------|-----------|
| [`jmes-testnet-1`](https://github.com/jmesworld/)                    | 2 | 4 GB   | 20 GB (SSD 5000 MB/s R/W) | 150 Mbps  |
| [`jmes-888`](https://github.com/jmesworld/)                    | 2 | 4 GB   | 20 GB (SSD 5000 MB/s R/W) | 150 Mbps  |

As the network grows, the minimum hardware requirements will also grow. It is recommended that you monitor the system so you can prevent it from running out of resources.
