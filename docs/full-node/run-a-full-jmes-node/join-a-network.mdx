# Join a network

You can either setup your own local private network or join a public network. If you want to join a public network (e.g. Testnet), you can skip to [join a public network](#join-a-public-network).

## Set up a local private network

### 1. Create a single node

The simplest JMES network you can set up is a local testnet with just a single node. In a single-node environment, you have one account and are the only validator signing blocks for your private network.

1. Initialize your genesis file that will bootstrap the network. Replace the following variables with your own information:

   ```bash
     jmesd init --chain-id=<private-network-id> <node-moniker>
   ```

2. Generate a JMES account. Replace the variable with your account name:

   ```bash
   jmesd keys add <account-name>
   ```
### 2. Add your account to the genesis

Run the following commands to add your account and set the initial balance:

```bash
jmesd add-genesis-account $(jmesd keys show <account-name> -a) 20000000000000ujmes
jmesd gentx <my-account> 100000000ujmes --chain-id=<private-network-id>
jmesd collect-gentxs
```

### 3. Start your private JMES network

Run the following command to start your private network:

```bash
jmesd start
# OR 
systemctl start jmesd    # runs as a system service in the background
```

If the private JMES network is set up correctly, your jmesd node will be running on `tcp://localhost:26656`, listening for incoming transactions, and signing blocks.

## Join a public network

### 1. Select a network

Specify the network you want to join by choosing the corresponding **genesis file** and **address book**:

	| Network     | Type    | Genesis                                                                                        | Address book                                                                              |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `jmes-testnet-1`   | Testnet | [Genesis Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-testnet-1/genesis.json) |  Peer List Community maintained by [JMES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-testnet-1/addrbook.json) |
| `jmes-888`   | Testnet | [Genesis Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-888/genesis.json) |  Peer List Community maintained by [JMES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-888/addrbook.json) |

### 2. Download genesis file and address book

**Genesis-transaction** specifies the account balances and parameters at the start of the network to use when replaying transactions and syncing.

**Addressbook** lists a selection of peers for your node to dial to in order to discover other nodes in the network. Public address books of peers are made available by the JMES community.

Choose a `testnet` or `mainnet` address type and download the appropriate genesis-transaction and addressbook. Links to these are posted in the [Select a network](#1-select-a-network) section.

- For default jmesd configurations, the `genesis` and `addressbook` files should be placed under `~/.jmes/config/genesis.json` and `~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json` respectively.

**Example**:

```bash
# Obtain the genesis for jmes-888:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-testnet-1/genesis.json -O ~/.jmes/config/genesis.json

# Obtain the addressbook for the jmes-888:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/main/jmes-testnet-1/addrbook.json -O ~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json
```

Continue to the [Sync](sync.mdx) page to find out more about syncing your node.
