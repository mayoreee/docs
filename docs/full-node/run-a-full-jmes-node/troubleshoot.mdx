# Reset and troubleshooting

## Complete reset

Occasionally you may need to perform a comlpete reset of your node due to data corruption or misconfiguration. Resetting will remove all data in `~/.jmes/data` and the addressbook in `~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json` and reset the node to genesis state.

To perform a complete reset of your JMESd state, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
jmesd tendermint unsafe-reset-all
```

Running this command successfully will produce the following log:

```
[ INF ] Removed existing address book file=/home/user/.jmes/config/addrbook.json
[ INF ] Removed all blockchain history dir=/home/user/.jmes/data
[ INF ] Reset private validator file to genesis state keyFile=/home/user/.jmes/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/home/user/.jmes/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Check the adressbook">

After resetting, make sure the addressbook contains peer addresses and is in the correct spot. If not, [download an adressbook](join-a-network.mdx#1-select-a-network) and place it in `~/.jmes/config/`.

### Change Genesis

To change the genesis version, delete `~/.jmes/config/genesis.json`.

You can recreate a genesis version via the following steps:

```bash
 jmesd add-genesis-account $(jmesd keys show <account-name> -a) 100000000ubJMES,1000usd
 jmesd gentx <account-name> 10000000ubJMES --chain-id=<network-name>
 jmesd collect-gentxs
```

### Reset personal data

<Admonition type="danger" icon="ðŸ”¥">

You may be unable to use your node and its associated accounts after changing your personal data. Do not perform this action unless your node is disposable.

</Admonition>

To change your personal data to a pristine state, delete both `~/.jmes/config/priv_validator_state.json` and `~/.jmes/config/node_key.json`.

### Node health

A healthy node will have the following files in place and populated:

- Addressbook `~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json`
- Genesis file `~/.jmes/config/genesis.json`
- Validator state `~/.jmes/config/priv_validator_state.json`
- Node key `~/.jmes/config/node_key.json`

### Resync

You can proceed to [resync manually](sync.mdx#sync-from-genesis) or [using a snapshot](sync.mdx#quicksync).
