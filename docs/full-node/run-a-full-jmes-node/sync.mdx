# Sync

This guide will walk you through how to [sync the chain from genesis](#sync-from-genesis) or use a [snapshot](#sync-from-snapshot) for a quicker sync.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Setup for successful sync">

Before you attempt to sync your node, confirm that you have properly set up your [system configuration](./system-config.mdx#system-configuration) and [built JMES core](./build-jmes-core.mdx#get-the-jmes-core-source-code).

## Sync from genesis

### JMES-testnet-1

1. Update the `persistent_peers` setting with a list of stable persistent peers in your `config.toml` file. Use the following commands:

```
PEERS=2a39d42bb299b913e5dbbaf9a5e458fb3ff7536b@164.92.191.45:26656,eb490967a016bbcb361ab2ba1f6d2a2ca1eb8593@46.101.197.51:26656
sed -i.bak -e "s|^persistent_peers *=.*|persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"|" $HOME/.jmes/config/config.toml
```

2. Finally, you can start the syncing process:

```py
jmesd start
# OR
systemctl start jmesd    # runs as a system service in the background
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Sync start times">

Nodes take about an hour to start syncing. This wait time is normal. Before troubleshooting a sync, please wait an hour for the sync to start.

</Admonition>

From here, you can [monitor the sync](#monitor-the-sync). Make sure to check on your node periodically to ensure optimal performance.

### Fast-sync for testing

Sometimes you may want to sync faster by foregoing checks. You may do so by adding the following flag to the `jmesd start` command.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

The following command should only be used by advanced users in non-production environments:

```bash
jmesd start --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
```

</Admonition>

## Sync from snapshot

You can significantly accelerate the synchronization process by providing jmesd with a recent snapshot of the network state. Snapshots are made publicly available by members of the JMES community one example can be downloaded from [Polkachu - Udo Mainnet](https://polkachu.com/state_sync/jmes). [Polkachu - Pisco Testnet](https://polkachu.com/testnets/jmesInstructions) is provided by Polkachu, and not maintained as part of this documentation.

### Before using snapshots

Certain files will need to be absent or deleted before downloading a snapshot. A quicksync replaces blockchain data with a custom snapshot. For most use cases, a "pruned" version is adequate. Pruned versions will have certain transactions removed from the archive to improve node performance. If you are running a node for archival purposes, you will want an `archive` or `default` download.

After choosing the appropriate download type, examine your node and ensure that `.jmes/data` is empty.

**Example**:

```bash
6:22PM INF Removed all blockchain history dir=/home/ubuntu/.jmes/data
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️">

If you are a validator, ensure that you do not remove your private key.

Example of a removed private key:

```bash
6:22PM INF Reset private validator file to genesis state keyFile=/home/ubuntu/.jmes/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/home/ubuntu/.jmes/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

</Admonition>

If you have an address book downloaded, you may keep it. Otherwise, you will need to download the [appropriate addressbook](./join-a-network.mdx#join-a-public-network).

With an address book downloaded, run the following:

```bash
jmesd start
jmesd status
# It will take a few seconds for jmesd to start.
```

## Monitor the sync

Your node is catching up with the network by replaying all the transactions from genesis and recreating the blockchain state locally. You can verify this process by checking the `latest_block_height` in the `SyncInfo` of the `jmesd status` response:

```json
  {
    "SyncInfo": {
        "latest_block_height": "42", <-----
        "catching_up"        : true
    },
  ...
  }
```

## Sync complete

You can tell that your node is in sync with the network when `SyncInfo.catching_up` in the `jmesd status` response returns `false` and the `latest_block_height` corresponds to the public network blockheight.

```bash
jmesd status
```

**Example**:

```json
  {
    "SyncInfo": {
        "latest_block_height": "7356350",
        "catching_up"        : false
    },
  ...
  }
```

## Congratulations!

You've successfully joined a network as a full node operator. If you are a validator, continue to [manage a JMES validator](../manage-a-jmes-validator/README.mdx) for next steps.
