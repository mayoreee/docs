# Build JMES Core

JMES Core is the official Golang reference implementation of the JMES node software. Use this guide to install JMES Core and jmesd, the command-line interface and daemon that connects to JMES and enables you to interact with the JMES blockchain.

## Get the JMES Core source code

1. Use `git` to retrieve [JMES Core](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/), and check out the `cosmwasm` branch, which contains the latest stable release. You can find the latest tag on the [tags page](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/tags) or via autocomplete in your terminal: type `git checkout v` and press `<TAB>`.

   ```
   git clone -b cosmwasm https://github.com/jmesworld/core
   cd core
   ```

2. Build JMES Core. This will install the JMESd executable to your [ `GOPATH` ](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) environment variable.

   ```bash
   cd app 
   go build
   ```

3. Verify that JMES Core is installed correctly.

   ```bash
   jmesd version --long
   ```

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   name: jmes
   server_name: jmesd
   version: v2.0.0
   commit: ea682c41e7e71ba0b182c9e7f989855fb9595885
   build_tags: netgo,ledger
   go: go version go1.18.2 darwin/amd64
   # ...followed by a lot of dependenecies
   ```

If the `jmesd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that the Go binary path is correctly configured by running the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
