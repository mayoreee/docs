# LocalJMES

LocalJMES is a complete JMES testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker and orchestrated with a simple `docker-compose` file. It allows smart contract developers to be able to test their contracts in a sandbox before they deploy them on a testnet or mainnet.

LocalJMES comes preconfigured with pragmatic defaults for standard testing environments. If other projects mention testing on LocalJMES, they are referring to the settings defined in this guide.

LocalJMES has the following advantages over a public testnet:

- Easily modifiable world states.
- Quick to reset for rapid iterations.
- Simple simulations of different scenarios.
- Controllable validator behaviour.
