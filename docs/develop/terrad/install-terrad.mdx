# Install JMESd

JMESd is the command-line interface and daemon that connects to JMES and enables you to interact with the JMES blockchain. JMES Core is the official Golang reference implementation of the JMES node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install JMESd and interact with the JMES Core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, use the documentation on how to [run a full JMES node](../../full-node/run-a-full-terra-node/README.mdx).

### Prerequisites

- [Golang v1.18 linux/amd64](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Ensure your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables are set up correctly.
- Linux users: install [build-essential](http://linux-command.org/en/build-essential.html).

If you are using a Mac, follow the [JMESd Mac installation guide](./jmesd-mac.mdx).

## From binary

The easiest way to install JMESd and JMES Core is by downloading a pre-built binary for your operating system. You can find the latest binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/releases). If you have a Mac, follow the [Mac installation instructions](./jmesd-mac.mdx).

## From source

### 1. Get the JMES Core source code

Use `git` to retrieve [JMES Core](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/) and check out the `main` branch, which contains the latest stable release.

```
git clone https://github.com/jmesworld/core
cd core
git checkout [latest version]
```

### 2. Build JMES Core from source

Build JMES Core, and install the JMESd executable to your `GOPATH` environment variable.

```bash
make install
```

### 3. Verify your JMES Core installation

Verify that JMES Core is installed correctly.

```bash
jmesd version --long
```

If JMES Core is installed correctly, you will get the following output:

```bash
name: jmes
server_name: jmesd
version: v2.0.0
commit: ea682c41e7e71ba0b182c9e7f989855fb9595885
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.18.2 darwin/amd64
```

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡">

If the `jmesd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that the Go binary path is correctly configured by running the following command:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## Next steps

With JMESd installed, you can set up a local testing environment using [LocalJMES](../localterra/README.mdx).
